            <h2>Some information about types of bytes</h2>
            <p>
                A bit is a binary digit, the smallest increment of data on a computer. A bit can hold only one of two
                values: 0 or 1, corresponding to the electrical values of off or on, respectively.

                Because bits are so small, you rarely work with information one bit at a time. Bits are usually
                assembled into a group of eight to form a byte. A byte contains enough information to store a single
                ASCII character, like "h".

                A kilobyte (KB) is 1,024 bytes, not one thousand bytes as might be expected, because computers use
                binary (base two) math, instead of a decimal (base ten) system.

                Computer storage and memory is often measured in megabytes (MB) and gigabytes (GB). A medium-sized novel
                contains about 1 MB of information. 1 MB is 1,024 kilobytes, or 1,048,576 (1024x1024) bytes, not one
                million bytes.

                Similarly, one 1 GB is 1,024 MB, or 1,073,741,824 (1024x1024x1024) bytes. A terabyte (TB) is 1,024 GB; 1
                TB is about the same amount of information as all of the books in a large library, or roughly 1,610 CDs
                worth of data. A petabyte (PB) is 1,024 TB. 1 PB of data, if written on DVDs, would create roughly
                223,100 DVDs, i.e., a stack about 878 feet tall, or a stack of CDs a mile high. Indiana University is
                now building storage systems capable of holding petabytes of data. An exabyte (EB) is 1,024 PB. A
                zettabyte (ZB) is 1,024 EB. Finally, a yottabyte (YB) is 1,024 ZB.

                Many hard drive manufacturers use a decimal number system to define amounts of storage space. As a
                result, 1 MB is defined as one million bytes, 1 GB is defined as one billion bytes, and so on. Since
                your computer uses a binary system as mentioned above, you may notice a discrepancy between your hard
                drive's published capacity and the capacity acknowledged by your computer. For example, a hard drive
                that is said to contain 10 GB of storage space using a decimal system is actually capable of storing
                10,000,000,000 bytes. However, in a binary system, 10 GB is 10,737,418,240 bytes. As a result, instead
                of acknowledging 10 GB, your computer will acknowledge 9.31 GB. This is not a malfunction but a matter
                of different definitions.

                You don’t need to yell

                The exclamation mark notation was introduced by French mathematician Christian Kramp in 1808. The idea
                of multiplying consecutive whole numbers has been around for centuries; people had been using this
                method to find out the distinct way to order multiple objects (i.e. permutation). Having this notation,
                as Kramp personally suggested, makes writing down things much easier.

                You might see it as Pi

                The need of multiplying numbers is not unique to the consecutive whole numbers. As a matter of fact,
                just like the need to add certain terms together (which we use the Sigma notation, Σ, to denote such
                operation), it is more common to see the product notation Π. A typical Pi notation works just like a
                Sigma notation; instead of adding, you just multiply each term!
            </p>
            <p>
                Mathematically speaking, calculating factorial is easy: you just multiply a bunch of numbers together.
                However, simple as it may seem, most computers don’t find the answer by just multiplying.
                The sheer value means there are certain limitations. Factorials are always integers because it’s the
                result of multiplying integers together.
                Modern computers covert our everyday numbers into binary, using only 0s and 1s, before they do any
                calculation.
                Older computers are limited to working with 32 binary digits, or bits, which translate to a maximum of
                2,147,483,647 in decimal.
                For the newer computers with 64-bit architecture, it can store an integer in decimal value up to
                9,223,372,036,854,775,807 .
                Which is a big number. But if you look at the table, you will see that a 32-bit computer can only
                calculate up to 12!,
                while 20! is the limit for a 64-bit computer.
                Beyond these boundaries, most common computers have to resort to approximation to provide an answer.
            </p>
            <p>
                So here it is, certain rules and tricks that you want to remember about factorials.

                0! = 1

                As weird as it may sound, this is a fact that we must remember. There are several ways to explain why
                this must be true. In mathematics, the empty product rule (which is very different than the “null factor
                law.” I have written an application of the null factor law in my previous blog, which you can find here)
                states that when we are multiplying no product, the result is set as default to the multiplicative
                identity, which is 1. 0! Literally means we are not multiplying any number, so it falls into the empty
                product rule. Thus, the result should be 1.

                Another way to explain 0! is to look at it like finding ways to order items. We learn from permutation
                that ! gives you the number of unique ways to order items in distinct sequence. Now think about what 0!
                represents; it is kind of like “how many ways are you able to put nothing in order.” And the answer is…
                1 way – by ordering nothing. More importantly, this definition fits into the model or permutation and
                combination.
